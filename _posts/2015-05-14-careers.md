# Careers page work
Like I did with the Team page, I thought about the goals a visitor may have. If someone is considering spring as an employer, what questions would they have?

1. What we do
  - products, moonshot goal
2. How we work
  - processes, software
  - show how the team is organized
  - links to engineering blog
  - photos might be nice
3. Where we work  
- though we're located at the wonderful 41 Union Sq West, New York, NY, we have Spring-ers all over the world
4. What are the perks?

The only set goal was to display the current open positions widget from recruiterbox, which I was able to do (though it still needs work).

## Header

## Sections

I thought of two hooks for the careers page section.

The first would be animated svgs (like the finger), or my work on <a href='https://www.mapbox.com/auto/#14/37.7577/-122.4135'>mapbox auto</a>.

# Recruiter Box

The bottom of the careers page would be the open positions (currentyl powered by recruiter box).

At the very bottom I think a make you own role position might be awesome (if that type of inquiry fits into your hiring strategy).
