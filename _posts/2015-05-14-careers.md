<h2>Overview</h2>

I spent most of my time this week implementing the Team page grid, and working on the careers page. I continued to iterate on the team page (making edits to the footer and header). I also continued to building out the styleguide.

When does development work on the web app begin? It would be good if we could sync/work in tandem so as to share css assets.

You can see the most up-to-date implementations here:

# Careers page work
Like I did with the Team page, I thought about the goals a visitor may have. If someone is considering spring as an employer, what questions would they have?

1. What we do
  - products, moonshot goal
2. How we work
  - processes, software
  - show how the team is organized
  - links to engineering blog
  - photos might be nice
3. Where we work  
- though we're located at the wonderful 41 Union Sq West, New York, NY, we have Spring-ers all over the world
4. What are the perks?

The only set goal was to display the current open positions widget from recruiterbox, which I was able to do (though it still needs work).

## Header

![careers head]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/careers/map-5.png)

---

## Sections

I thought of two hooks for the careers page sections.

The first would be animated svgs (like the finger), or my work on <a href='https://www.mapbox.com/auto/#14/37.7577/-122.4135'>mapbox auto</a>.

![sections]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/careers/sections-1.png)

The second would be to reuse the code and theme from the team page in a new wa, arranging photos in a way to make them exciting to explore

![where]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/careers/section-how-2.png)

The final idea was to include a world map with the locations of all Spring-ers

This execution needs work though.

# Recruiter Box

The bottom of the careers page would be the open positions (currentyl powered by recruiter box).

I need to continue working with recruiter box to allow people to filter by department.

At the very bottom I think a make you own role position might be awesome (if that type of inquiry fits into your hiring strategy).

# Implementation

You can see the changes to the implementation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/iterations/careers-1.html)

####Progress
- dark header made

- Styleguide refinement


---

# Team Page Updates


## Header 

- Letter Spacing
- new flair

1. creative commons

![sections]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/team/team-images.png)

2. neon


- Javascript Grid work (still need to implement rippling)
- sticky-nav (reused on the careers page)

---

## The Grid

powered by a JSON object, dynamically placed.

![employee]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/team/employee.png)

now I need to add the ripple effect, real data, and a better hover state.

---

## Footer 

![footer]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/team/team-footer-2.png)

I want to test out buttons here as well.
