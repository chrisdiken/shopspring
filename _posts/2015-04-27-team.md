After meeting on wednesday, I began mapping out what elements would make for a successful team page. The goals for page, as outlined by Vivi are 

1. show the value of the team
2. show how the team is organized

I spent some time thinking about the headspace of individuals that would visit the team page.

- "Do I want to work at Spring?"
- "Who would I work with?"
- "What would my responsibilities be?"

With these goals and use cases in mind, I made a list of elements that would solve them.

## Elements
1. Mission Statement
  - sell people on the goal
2. a "we're hiring" callout, with a button to redirect to open positions
3. blurb on how awesome the team is
  - backgrounds
  - diversity stats?
4. Org Dept Navigation
  - Blurb about different departments, if selected
5. Team members
  - bios
  - photos
